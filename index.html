            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Original Artifact</h2>
            <p>The original artifact was a C++ program designed in CS-300. The goal was to allow users to 
                read in a file of courses along with associated prerequisite courses, print a list of courses 
                to the console after sorting the elements in alphanumeric order by course title, and look-up a 
                course to print the associated prerequisite course numbers to the console. I specifically chose 
                this artifact because it was limited in scope, and I saw many areas that could be improved upon to 
                increase the amount of value delivered to users. Furthermore, since this was created in a lower level 
                course, I identified many areas lacking in security or not following coding best practices.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Code Review</h2>
            <p>A code review is a process in which a software developer examines code written by another developer 
                or dated code by the same individual in the case of this project, to improve the code quality by 
                identifying bugs or potential security vulnerabilities and adherence to general coding or language-specific 
                best practices. This is an important step in the growth process of software developers because knowledge can 
                be shared, and this communication allows team members to ensure every individual understands the standard in 
                the same fashion. Additionally, this process can prevent future bugs or vulnerabilities by making past errors 
                obvious and then by recommending possible solutions. Best practices of code reviews include only reviewing 
                200 to 400 lines of code at a time to ensure the code is being properly analyzed, taking your time when analyzing 
                code to reduce the likelihood of missing errors, using a checklist, establishing a process for fixing defects, 
                and maintaining a positive attitude. Code reviews should occur during the ‘development’ phase of the software 
                development lifecycle, and more specifically after the coding and testing are complete and have been passed, but 
                before the code is integrated or pushed to a main repository. This ensures that the code is complete and free 
                from surface-level or simple errors, but it also ensures that the unit is properly reviewed before being merged 
                into the existing code and potentially negatively impacting other units or the project. </p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</h2>
            <p>The artifact was improved upon in several ways. First, functionality was added to allow users to 
                dynamically add courses once the program is running, delete courses, and manage an individual course’s 
                prerequisites through addition or deletion. Next, best practices were addressed by the removal of unnecessary 
                comments and leftover testing lines of code, the inclusion of more descriptive and higher-quality comments 
                at the top of the file and beginning of large functions, memory management through data structure and pointer 
                deletion proper range checking when adding prerequisites, and input validation and length limiting. 
                Finally, what was once a single .cpp file is now segmented into a main.cpp, functions.cpp/.h, Course.cpp/.h, 
                and CourseLoader.cpp/.h. This separation of classes follows object-oriented programming principles and will make 
                the codebase easier to manage in the future and provide the opportunity to reuse certain elements within other 
                components.</p>
            <p>The main challenge associated with modifying this artifact was fully understanding the functionality of code that 
                was written over a year ago, and then being able to properly identify vulnerabilities and how to integrate fixes 
                into the code. Most of my time during this Milestone was spent analyzing and reverse-engineering the code and 
                planning exactly how I could add functionality without negatively affecting the already functional code. 
                Furthermore, the process of designing the entire system, classes, and inheritance was somewhat tedious, 
                but through the use of brainstorming and a UML Class Diagram, I now feel that the program is far more robust and 
                aligns better with industry standards.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures</h2>
            <p>The data structure included in the original codebase was a vector, which is simple to understand and code, 
                but this enhancement required me to design and implement an AVL tree, which is a form of a balanced binary tree. 
                This enhancement was warranted because inserting and sorting a new course into a vector resulted in O (n log n) 
                time complexity, while switching to an AVL tree resulted in O (log n) time complexity. Designing the AVL tree 
                class was by far the most challenging aspect of this milestone, and in particular, the functions required to 
                balance the tree via left or right rotations were the most novel concepts to me. Throughout this process, I gained 
                a greater understanding of balanced trees in general, and more specifically I learned the process of checking the 
                height of a node’s children and then rotating that node in various ways to produce a balanced tree.</p>
            <p>I was able to meet all the course outcomes that I planned on meeting, and the work produced during this module 
                most closely relates to course outcome 3. I successfully analyzed the original software and data structure to identify 
                areas of improvement, designed a new data structure, programmed the data structure, and then integrated the structure 
                into the program to ensure proper functionality with the preexisting Course class objects. This core design choice uses 
                computer science knowledge and algorithmic principles gained throughout this course to accomplish the goal in the 
                most efficient way possible.</p>

            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Enhancement Three: Databases</h2>
            <p>The original codebase included no database integration whatsoever, so I was able to design and develop the database from 
                scratch. I chose to utilize SQLite due to its easy integration into Visual Studio C++ projects. Not only did I create a 
                new database and table, but I also prevented SQL injection through secure coding best practices and prepared statements. 
                Furthermore, this was my first time creating an SQL trigger. The trigger functions by updating a timestamp column any 
                time a row is created or updated. This is particularly useful in real-world applications for keeping track of data changes. 
                This trigger creation was the toughest part of this module because I was unsure of the proper syntax to use within SQLite. </p>
